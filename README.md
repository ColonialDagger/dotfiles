# Dotfiles
This is my dotfile. 

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My dotfile is my best friend. It is my life.

I must master it as I must master my life.

My dotfile, without me, is useless.

Without my dotfile, I am useless.

I must configure my dotfile true.

My dotfile and myself know that what counts in computing is not the number of packages installed, nor the flash of a desktop environment, but the precision of the command, and the elegance of the script.

My dotfile is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother.

I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its packages, and its dependencies.

I will guard it against the ravages of defaults and incompatibilities as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, and my heart against damage.

I will keep my dotfile clean and ready. We will become a part of each other.

Before God, I swear this creed. My dotfile and myself are defenders of this configuration.

We are the masters of our enemy.

We are the saviours of my life.
